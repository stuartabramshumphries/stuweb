  employer: Quadrature Capital 
  job: Working on a project to assist migration of legacy configuration management code in Puppet to Salt stack, additional project involved upgrade of main trading servers in several co-los to Ubuntu 1804 and Pacemaker (multiple three node clusters with drbd). Used opportunity to automate configuration of Gitlab and Gitlab runners, also building a highly available remote access solution. Additionally, providing an automated test environment using Docker containers to ensure new code passes at least some basic tests.
- years: Dec 2017 – Dec 2018
  employer: Home Office 
  job: At the Home Office I was responsible for a project to move critical Oracle database servers from an external supplier to AWS. I also built out a new environment in AWS in London (new build from scratch replicating existing environment in Dublin). All AWS configuration was written using Terraform. For the external security testers, I provided a basic K8 environment with bespoke Docker containers to provide isolated environments for penetration testing, additionally secured passwords and keys in Hashicorp vault.
- years: Aug 2017 – Dec 2017	
  employer: PICO Quantitative Trading
  job: At Pico I was hired to work on a project to enable them to sell time synchronisation as a service. My work involved designing time synchronisation systems that complied with RTS25 standards for financial trading clients. In depth work involved system builds, automation using Ansible and bash/python scripts. Additionally, for long term reporting purposes I built a data collection service in AWS, initially populated by using Amazon Snowball, but then syncing from over 20 remote datacentres to various S3, and automating older data to move to Amazon Glacier. 
- years: Dec 2016 – Aug 2017 
  employer: HSBC
  job: I was brought in to HSBC to work on a project in the FX pricing team to enable the support work to be offshored to China. To do this work I automated multiple processes and builds to Puppet.

Used TeamCity to test/rollout builds.
- years: May 2016 – Dec 2016
  employer: DWP
  job: At the DWP I was responsible as part of a team for the migration of the systems (140 different Java based microservices) from multiple VMware instances to AWS. AWS configuration was initially done using CloudFormation, however we migrated to using Terraform as environment grew. My initial project work involved moving away from Jenkins/GitHub on physical servers to Docker swarm on AWS, additionally I configured Jenkins to use the AWS EC2 plugin to use larger Amazon instances for some of the bigger testing that needed doing.
- years: Feb 2016 –May 2016 
  employer: RKR Epsilon
  job: Completely Greenfield site (Prop trading start-up), responsible for install and configuration of entire infrastructure from scratch. I chose Ansible for configuration management of our physical servers as a relatively small, simple environment. I worked alongside developers and quants to ensure automated build/test and deployment of code to trading environment, for this I installed and configured the Atlassian tool suite as management wanted products they could go to for paid support. I installed and configured a continuous integration system– from check-in of code in git, testing in Docker containers and rpm build and release to servers. I also implemented basic Agile environment.  For main non trading infrastructure we used Google Cloud and associated email, documents.

  employer: Worldpay
  job: Large scale migration of applications from RBS legacy hardware to Worldpay new systems. Started with 10s of Red Hat servers – on leaving we had in excess of 4000 nodes built and managed. Initial migration was primarily to VMWare instances, however we influenced Worldpay to move to AWS environment – then started migration to AWS. This allowed large cost savings as we were able to use servers on demand and shutdown out of hours when not being used by development teams. 
- years: Jun 2013 – Sep 2014  
  employer: Jump Trading
  job: First in-depth exposure to DevOps – large environment of over 3000 servers, all automated using Puppet, Phabricator, GIT. Sat with Developers (Quants) and assisted with day-to-day issues.

Small evaluation of AWS for our HPC grid, however this was abandoned after initial testing due to poor (relative) performance of disk i/o at the time with AWS compared to a dedicated clustered filesystem.
